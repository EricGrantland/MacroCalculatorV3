This application is used to calculate the user's daily macronutrient goals to be used for carb cycling.
When carb cycling, the idea is to rotate "low carb days" and "high carb days" based on your overall fitness
goals. By using this app, you can calculate your desired overall calorie intake, as well as your macronutrients
for both "low carb" and "high carb" days. To run the application, simply fill out the requested
information in the text fields/radio buttons and select the "Calculate" button in the middle of the window.
You should readjust your daily intake after every 5 lbs that you lose. This eliminates the hassle of
manually calculating your macronutrients every time you lose 5 lbs!
